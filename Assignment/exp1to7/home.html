    The Central Library functions as the primary information resource centre, and repository of all printed and e-resources 
    for teaching and research activities at the institute. Apart from textbooks and recommended reading material prescribed 
    for each course offered at the institute, the library houses a growing collection of research monographs, reports, 
    multi-volume reference works, dictionaries, encyclopedias, handbooks, and so on. The library facilitates access to a 
    number of journals through its participation in consortia, such as INDEST. The library also subscribes to several e-journals 
    directly from publishers as well as through reputed subscription agencies. The library operations are automated using KOHA software. 
    The Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) enables library users know their collection status, issue history. Users can place online 
    reservations, browse for new additions of books, journals subscribed. A separate e-resources section is provided in the library 
    to browse e-journals & e-books.
